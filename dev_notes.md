- [ ] fix console overflow
- [ ] merge at least one PR
- [ ] improve terminal onboarding? Nem que seja só um pouquinho...
- [ ] test on linux
- [ ] version bump

> Hopefully now:
- [ ] live console input should alto re-enable auto scroll, and should scroll down when auto scroll is enabled
- [ ] update README
- [ ] maybe hardcode if(recipeName == plume) to open the readme in a new tab
- [ ] add new hardware bans
- [ ] make `playerController.writePending` prioritized (low 5s, medium 30s, high 60s)
- [ ] create `admin.useroptions` for dark mode, welcome modals and such
- [ ] remove the ForceFXServerPort config and do either via `server.cfg` comment, or execute `endpoint_add_tcp "127.0.0.1:random"`
- [ ] clean github Issues/PRs
- [ ] add discord group whitelist (whitelist switch becomes a select box that will enable guildID and roleID)
        ---- 2 opções: estar na guild ou ter role na guild
- [ ] persistent discord status message that is set up by `!setmessage`:
        - this will trigger a big status message to be sent in that channel
        - this message id can be stored in the config file
        - if discord id is present, use that instead of name (careful with the pings!)

- [ ] the Commands card in the dashboard is underused since resource commands are useless and nobody knows the kick all and broadcast options are there

- [ ] apply the new action log html to the modal
- [ ] add `<fivem://connect/xxxxx>` to `/status` by getting `web_baseUrl` maybe from the heartbeat
- [ ] add ban server-side ban cache (last 500 bans?), updated on every ban change 
- [ ] add a commend system?
- [ ] add stopwatch (or something) to the db functions and print on `/diagnostics`
- [ ] change webserver token every time the server starts

> Soon™® (hopefully in two months or so)
- [ ] get all functions from `web\public\js\txadmin\players.js` and wrap in some object.
- [ ] add some chart to the players page?
- [ ] tweak dashboard update checker behavior
- [ ] add an fxserver changelog page
- [ ] Social auth provider setup retry every 15 seconds
- [ ] show error when saving discord settings with wrong token
- [ ] break down playerController into separate files!
- [ ] rename playerController to playerManager?


## NUI commands
While the menu is open, show `ID | PlayerName` above nearby player heads.
The first thing selected is the tab selector, which can be operated using the arrows.
The Main menu will be fully arrow operated, but the player and txAdmin tab need to be mouse-operated

- Main Menu:
    - Teleport (submenu):
        - TP to coords (use regex)
        - TP to Marker
        - Send back (<name>) (me to my last, or player to his last)
    - Player mode (selector):
        - Nornal
        - NoClip/Invisible
        - God Mode
    - Heal Myself 
    - Spawn Car
    - Fix+Wash Car
    - Revive/Heal all players (temp)
    - Send Announcement (temp)
- Player Tab:
    - search box
    - sort options
    - player cards:
        - basic modal (DM, Warn, Kick, Ban)
        - Heal
        - TP Player to me
        - TP to Player
        - Spectate
- txAdmin Tab:
    - iframe containing txAdmin's web with some customizations:
        - menu starts collapsed
        - no logo/header
        - no footer

## Database Management page
- erase all whitelists
- erase all bans
- erase all warnings
- Prune Database:
    All options will be select boxes containing 3 options: none, conservative, aggressive
    - Players (without notes) innactive for xxx days: 60, 30
    - Warns older than xx days: 30, 7
    - Bans: revoked, revoked or expired
Add a note that to erase the entire database, the user should delete the `playersDB.json` (full path) file and restart txAdmin.
Pre calculate all counts
